You can also disable some parts of the mod, but it is not guaranteed that everything works fine and is balanced then. There is also a \"vampire_realism_mode\" which changes quite a lot of balance options at one to make it more \"realistic\" out of a \"vampire book/movie\" point of view."

In case you haven't changed anything, it is very recommend to use the \"/resetBalance\" after updating Vampirism to a new version to apply changed default balance values."
